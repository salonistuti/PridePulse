            "Dissociative systems describe the experience of having multiple, distinct identities or personality states, known as alters, within a single individual. This is a complex psychological condition that primarily arises as a response to severe trauma, often during early childhood. It's a protective mechanism, allowing individuals to distance themselves from experiences of trauma.",

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder-1 (OSDD-1) is similar to DID but does not meet all its diagnostic criteria. OSDD-1 patients might have alters who are less distinct or experience less amnesia.",
