The "Lipstick Lesbian Flag" <:_:1115867721737977877> was the first design of the now more modern flag in 2010 and later had "Pink Flag" <:_:1115867480649379840> in 2015. These flags adopted horizontal stripes harkening to the Rainbow Pride Flag designed by Gilbert Baker but in a gradient of pink and white. Finally, in 2018 a woman on Tumblr named Emily Gwen posted her idea for the lesbian flag called "Sunset Lesbian Flag" <:_:1115868994746974320> which has 7 stripes and was later simplified to 5 aka now " Lesbian Pride Flag" <:_:1108868440363642930>.
